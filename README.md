# About
This repo represents work that is being done to investigate and clean the datasets provided during   
Aleksandra's summer research project with Dr. Jonathan Gryak at CUNY Queens College.  

Note the actual repo for the models and data is private: https://github.com/gryakj/ml-food-allergy   

Using this repo for saftey and for my own version control to avoid cluttering or corruption of the main project repo.   
Once I have cleaned the dataset I will update the ml-food-allergy repo   

this repo name: drgryak-summerreasearch
