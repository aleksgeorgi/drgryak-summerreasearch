    "__Initial Dose Escalation:__ This will occur on a single day in which multiple doses are given. Peanut or placebo dosing will be given incrementally and increase every 15-30 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour is given. The first four doses will be administered as a peanut flour extract of 0.1 to 0.8 mg peanut protein, which is 10 to 80 microliters peanut flour extract, or placebo flour extract and the last three doses will be given as peanut flour of 3 to 12 mg peanut flour 1.5 to 6 mg peanut protein or placebo flour. Participants must tolerate a dose of at least 3 mg peanut flour (1.5 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour to remain in the study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Build-up:__ After the initial dose escalation day, the participant will return to the research unit the next morning for an observed dose administration of the highest tolerated dose from the initial escalation day. The participant will then continue on the daily OIT dosing at home and return to the research unit every 2 weeks for a dose escalation. The dosing escalations will be consistent with previous similar OIT studies.\n",

At the completion of this phase participants will have a final blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).
